Note
-Log each operation that you do.
-Try to minimize number of api calls if possible.
-Try to avoid waiting for log promise to finish.
-Sign in and getBooks Promise rejections must always give appropriate responseCode and reason.
    reason: string     example - Auth Failure  or Service failure
    responseCode: number -  example: 401 or 500
-Activity Logs should be stored in an array.

Function signature: takes a single argument username and returns a promise.
Returned Promise's value is based on seconds (getSeconds) from current date.
only resolve the promise if seconds are greater than 30 

Q. Write a getBooks method that returns a promise
it picks a random integer between [0 and 1].
if integer picked is 1 ..it resolves the promise with list of Books
else rejects the promise saying service error.
